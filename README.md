# Game of Life ![](https://travis-ci.org/jandlouhy/game-of-life.svg?branch=master)
Based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## How to run the game?
Just clone the repo, install dependencies with `composer install` and run the game with `php index.php game:run`.

## About the project
This little project was written to show my programming skills. I preffered clean code over speed, so this solution don't have to be the fastes you've ever seen.
